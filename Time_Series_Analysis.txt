Note: 
Time series analysis attempts to understand the past and predict the future.
  - Random walk is described as a DTSP.
  - Trends.
  - Seasonal Variation.
  - Serial Correlation. 
R has many time series libraries.
Model:
  - Correlation
  - Forecasting
  - Regression - deterministic (not stochastic) trends
  - Stationary - mean+variance are constant. MA, ARMA
  - Non-Stationary - ARIMA, ARCH, GARCH
  - Multivariate Modeling
  - State-Space Models

#2.SERIAL CORRELATION IN TIME SERIES ANALYSIS

Note:
  - Serial Correlation = Autocorrelation
  - Improve the realism of any simulated time series based on the model.
Stationary in Time Series
Mean is a function fo time.
Decompose the time series to remove any deterministic trends and seasonality effects, resulting in a resedual series.
Stationary in mean and variance.
### Serial Correlation
Second Order Stationary
  - A time series is second order stationary if ther correlation between sequential observations is only a function of the lag.
Sample autocorrivance and sample autocorrelation 
Correlogram is a plot of autocorrelation functionfor sequential values of lag k from 1 to n.
