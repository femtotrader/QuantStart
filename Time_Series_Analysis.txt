#1. BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO TIME SERIES ANALYSIS
Basic Concepts
Url: [https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Beginners-Guide-to-Time-Series-Analysis]
Note: 
Time series analysis attempts to understand the past and predict the future.
  - Random walk is described as a DTSP.
  - Trends.
  - Seasonal Variation.
  - Serial Correlation. 
R has many time series libraries.
Model:
  - Correlation
  - Forecasting
  - Regression - deterministic (not stochastic) trends
  - Stationary - mean+variance are constant. MA, ARMA
  - Non-Stationary - ARIMA, ARCH, GARCH
  - Multivariate Modeling
  - State-Space Models

#2.SERIAL CORRELATION IN TIME SERIES ANALYSIS
Use ACF to detect trend and seasonality effects
Url: [https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Serial-Correlation-in-Time-Series-Analysis]
Note:
  - Serial Correlation = Autocorrelation
  - Improve the realism of any simulated time series based on the model.
Stationary in Time Series
Mean is a function fo time.
Decompose the time series to remove any deterministic trends and seasonality effects, resulting in a resedual series.
Stationary in mean and variance.
### Serial Correlation
Second Order Stationary
  - A time series is second order stationary if ther correlation between sequential observations is only a function of the lag.
Sample autocorrivance and sample autocorrelation 
Correlogram is a plot of autocorrelation functionfor sequential values of lag k from 1 to n.

There are a few notable features of the correlogram plot in R:
  > Firstly, since the sample correlation of lag k=0k=0 is given by r0=c0c0=1r0=c0c0=1 we will always have a line of height equal to unity at lag k=0k=0 on the plot. In fact, this provides us with a reference point upon which to judge the remaining autocorrelations at subsequent lags. Note also that the y-axis ACF is dimensionless, since correlation is itself dimensionless.
  > The dotted blue lines represent boundaries upon which if values fall outside of these, we have evidence against the null hypothesis that our correlation at lag kk, rkrk, is equal to zero at the 5% level. However we must take care because we should expect 5% of these lags to exceed these values anyway! Further we are displaying correlated values and hence if one lag falls outside of these boundaries then proximate sequential values are more likely to do so as well. In practice we are looking for lags that may have some underlying reason for exceeding the 5% level. For instance, in a commodity time series we may be seeing unanticipated seasonality effects at certain lags (possibly monthly, quarterly or yearly intervals).
From Correlogram, we could tell trend and seasonality effects.

###3. WHITE NOISE AND RANDOM WALKS IN TIME SERIES ANALYSIS

Url:[https://www.quantstart.com/articles/White-Noise-and-Random-Walks-in-Time-Series-Analysis]
Let's summarise the general process we will be following throughout the series:
  >Outline a hypotheis about a particular time series and its behaviour
  >Obtain the correlogram of the time series (perhaps using R or Python libraries) and assess its serial correlation
  >Use our knowledge of time series models and fit an appropriate model to reduce the serial correlation in the residuals (see below for a definition) of the model and its time series
  >Refine the fit until no correlation is present and use mathematical criteria to assess the model fit
  >Use the model and its second-order properties to make forecasts about future values
  >Assess the accuracy of these forecasts using statistical techniques (such as confusion matrices, ROC curves for classification or regressive metrics such as MSE, MAPE etc)
  >Iterate through this process until the accuracy is optimal and then utilise such forecasts to create trading strategies

Backward Shift and Difference Operators
Discrete White Noise
Gaussian White Noise

Random Walk
A random walk is non-stationary.

#4.AUTOREGRESSIVE MOVING AVERAGE ARMA(P, Q) MODELS FOR TIME SERIES ANALYSIS - PART 1
Url: [https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Autoregressive-Moving-Average-ARMA-p-q-Models-for-Time-Series-Analysis-Part-1]
Financial time series posses a Volatility clustering
OR called conditional heteroskedasticity.
AR, MR, ARMA are not conditional heteroskedasticity.
###Strict Stationary.
  > In mathematics and statistics, a stationary process (or strict(ly) stationary process or strong(ly) stationary process) is a stochastic process whose joint probability distribution does not change when shifted in time. Consequently, parameters such as the mean and variance, if they are present, also do not change over time and do not follow any trends.
  > Strict Stationary. A time series model is strictly stationary if the joint statistical distribution of the elements xt1->xtn is the same as that of xt1+m->xtn+m.
    One can think of this definition as simply that the distribution of the time series is unchanged for any abritrary shift in time.
###Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
AIC is a tool to aid in model selection.
Information Theory: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory]
AIC: L maximised the likelihood, k parameter, AIC is given by: AIC = -2log(L) + 2k

### AR of order p
Autoregressive on order p
x_t = a_1*x_t-1 + ... + a_p*x_t-p + w_t
AR is an extension of random walk.
AR(p) is not always stationary. 
* Use characteristic equation to determine whether an AR process is stationary or not. We need al the absolute values of the roots of this equation to exceed unity.
* Second Order Properties- Yule-Walker equations.
