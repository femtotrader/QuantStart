Note: 
Time series analysis attempts to understand the past and predict the future.
  - Random walk is described as a DTSP.
  - Trends.
  - Seasonal Variation.
  - Serial Correlation. 
R has many time series libraries.
Model:
  - Correlation
  - Forecasting
  - Regression - deterministic (not stochastic) trends
  - Stationary - mean+variance are constant. MA, ARMA
  - Non-Stationary - ARIMA, ARCH, GARCH
  - Multivariate Modeling
  - State-Space Models

Note:
  - Serial Correlation = Autocorrelation
  - Improve the realism of any simulated time series based on the model.
